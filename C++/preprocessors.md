# Preprocessors

Directives which give instructions to the compiler to preprocess information before compilation starts.
- start with `#`
- not `C++` statements so do not end in `;`

<br />

## #include:
---
Includes contents of specified file at point where directive appears.
- `header` files are included in `cpp` files but *not* compiled
  - only `cpp` files are compiled
